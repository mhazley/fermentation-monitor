### Debugging Photon

A wiki has been written to explain how to use this directory. Please read [this](https://github.com/teambrewbot/brewbot-firmware/wiki/Debugging-Photon) post for more information on 
how to debug with the programmer shield, a photon and the `make program-debug` command. You may need to do a make upgrade when moving back from debug mode as the system firmware
has been bundled into one binary with the application code.
